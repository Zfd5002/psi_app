## v1.2.9n5

Why:
- Fix `semantic_fingerprint` always returning `""` (empty string) in both stored
  and anchored replay verify output, causing the smoke test assertion
  `stored + replay semantic_fingerprint must be non-empty` to fail.

Root cause:
- `_semantic_fingerprint()` in `verify.py` called `compute_snapshot_content_hash()`
  with a single positional argument. That function requires three keyword arguments
  (`inputs_obj`, `outputs_obj`, `evidence_ids`). The call always raised `TypeError`,
  which was silently swallowed by the surrounding `except Exception: return ""`.
  The function has been broken since it was introduced; the n4 smoke test assertion
  exposed it by fixing the earlier `snapshot_content_hash` mismatch that was
  masking this failure.

What changed:
- `psi/services/di/verify.py`: `_semantic_fingerprint()` now computes
  `sha256(stable_json(stripped_outputs))` directly, which is what the function
  always intended — a self-contained hash of the output payload with volatile
  fields (`engine.code_version`, `provenance.integrity`) removed. `hashlib`
  moved to module-level import.

What did NOT change:
- No policy changes.
- No selector changes.
- No DB changes / migrations.
- No changes to `snapshot_content_hash`, `evidence_fingerprint`, or
  `decision_output_hash_v2` — those are correct and stable.

## v1.2.9n4

Why:
- Fix `snapshot_content_hash` mismatch between runner and anchored replay.
  Root cause: `scope_id` type inconsistency — runner stored `scope_id` as a string
  (from callers passing `str(b.id)`), but verify.py reconstructed `DIInput` with
  `scope_id=int(...)`. `compute.py` wrote `di_in.scope_id` directly into
  `outputs.provenance.inputs_fingerprint`, producing `"7"` (str) in stored outputs
  and `7` (int) in anchored replay outputs. `_stable_json` serializes these
  differently, causing `snapshot_content_hash` to differ.

What changed:
- `psi/services/di/compute.py`: normalize `scope_id` to `int` in
  `provenance.inputs_fingerprint`.
- `psi/services/di/runner.py`: normalize `scope_id` to `int` in `inputs_obj`
  at all 3 call sites.
- `psi/core/di/schema.py`: added `__post_init__` to `DIInput` to coerce `scope_id`
  to `int` at construction. Catches `str(b.id)` callers at the entry point.
- `psi/tools/di_contract_smoke.py`: fixed `scope_id=str(b.id)` → `int(b.id)`.

What did NOT change:
- No policy changes. No selector changes. No DB changes / migrations.

## v1.2.9n3

Why:
- Fix anchored replay snapshot_content_hash mismatch by ensuring runner and anchored replay compute operate on identical in-memory SoE types.

What changed:
- DI shared compute now normalizes `ignored_evidence` entries to `IgnoredEvidence` objects before SoE packing and downstream logic.

What did NOT change:
- No policy changes.
- No selector changes.
- No DB changes / migrations.
